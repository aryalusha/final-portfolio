              <h3 >Project Overview</h3>
              <p>The Inventory & Accounting System is an integrated solution designed for food businesses like restaurants and accounting firms. It combines POS (Point of Sale) features with real-time inventory tracking and financial reporting to streamline daily operations and financial management.<br>

                The system enables managers to monitor inventory in real-time, receive low-stock alerts, and restock supplies efficiently. On the accounting side, it provides insights into daily transactions, profit/loss trends, and financial reports, along with tools for strategic planning, tax preparation, and access to financial services.<br>
                
                Accounting firms can also use the system to manage client financials, track transactions, and analyze financial trends.
                
                By combining inventory management, POS, and accounting features, the system simplifies operations, improves efficiency, and provides actionable insights for better financial and operational decision-making.</p>

              <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
              <p>Food businesses like restaurants and accounting firms face challenges in managing real-time inventory tracking, supplier delays, and financial reporting. Existing systems are often disjointed, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and difficulties in making informed operational and financial decisions.

                There is a need for an integrated solution that combines POS capabilities, real-time inventory tracking, and financial insights to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and provide actionable insights for better decision-making.</p>

                    Some of the challenges were: <br><br>
                    1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ease of Use for All Experience Levels: An intuitive system that ensures even employees with zero technical or accounting knowledge can learn quickly and perform transactions without extensive training.<br><br>
                    2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Real-Time Inventory Monitoring: Providing real-time inventory tracking to ensure managers can monitor stock levels, track supplies, and respond quickly to low inventory situations without operational delays.<br><br>
                    3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Easy-to-Use POS System: Creating a user-friendly POS system that can be used by staff with varying technical knowledge, including employees with zero prior experience in POS systems.<br><br>

                <p>
                    1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Brainstorming & Sketching: With the feature list and user stories in hand, begin brainstorming design solutions that address user needs. Sketched out rough ideas for the layout, user flow, and key screens.<br><br>
                    2.&nbsp; &nbsp; User Flow Mapping: Providing real-time inventory tracking to ensure managers can monitor stock levels, track supplies, and respond quickly to low inventory situations without operational delays.<br><br>
                    3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Information Architecture (IA):<br> In accounting side,Organized the software’s features and functions into a logical structure that users can navigate intuitively & also Developed a sitemap and decide on menu structures, categorizing functions under accessible headers like "Income," "Expenses," "Reports," etc.<br><br>
                    In POS side, We organized the system’s features and functions into a logical structure that restaurant staff and managers can easily navigate, ensuring a smooth workflow.We even developed a sitemap and define menu structures, categorizing features under accessible headers like: Orders, Inventory, Sales, Staff, Reports & performance.
                    <br><br>
                    3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Wireframing: We Created a low-fidelity wireframes to outline the basic layout of each screen. This helps visualize how information is structured and where key elements will be placed.We Kept the designs minimal and functional at this stage to focus on layout and flow rather than visual aesthetics.

                    "While this overview captures the main steps, the research process itself was far more detailed, involving iterative testing, refining ideas, and revisiting key elements to align with user feedback and evolving project goals. This groundwork laid a strong foundation for the system's design and development."

                <p>
                    Prepare Design Specification :&nbsp; &nbsp;- We created a detailed design specifications for the development team, covering aspects like color codes, spacing, font sizes, and interactions.
                    We Used design collaboration tools (e.g., Figma ) to ensure clear communication and maintain consistency between design and development.<br><br>
                    Collaborate with Developers :&nbsp; &nbsp;-We Worked closely with developers to address any technical challenges in implementing the designand made sure we will be available for clarifications, and conduct regular reviews to ensure design fidelity throughout the development process.As first phase was complete we started design side by side as it would be easier to communicate on anything.<br><br>
                    Responsive Design & Accessibility :&nbsp; &nbsp; We ensured the design adapts to different screen sizes and devices, making Srot accessible on mobile, tablet, and desktop. This was only for website not for whole software.Webapp was fully web focused because it would be impossible to make it responsive due to complication. So, we have made app afterwards.<br><br>
